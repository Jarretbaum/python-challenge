Mod 3 challenge

The majority resource that I used was just going back and watching recordings from past classes to refresh my memory on which functions or statements I need to be focusing in on. I received guidance and assistance from a couple online resources, including discussions and help from Stackoverflow, Learning Assistant(I only asked syntax questions this time, but looking to lean into it more.), and the OpenAI community, in writing this code.


Stackoverflow articles that helped me along the way: 

1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65125710/algorithm-to-find-the-maximum-profit
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27428813/python-export-result-value-to-text-file (using a with statement!!!)
3. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70890751/python-read-csv-file-by-pandas
4. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52731049/including-a-tie-into-a-while-loop (good refresher on 'for' loops)
